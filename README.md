## Notes

I encountered issues with dragging and dropping the table view into the DetailViewController I created. I was supposed to be dragging the post from the left hand bar into the DetailViewcontroller rather than dragging the table view from viewcontroller to viewcontroller. I also had some naming issues, but was able to resolve them quickly after a few minutes reviewing my varibale names.
